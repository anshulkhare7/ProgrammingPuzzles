# Binary Tree Level Order

This class of problems involve traversing the binary level by level. Here are a few versions of the problems based on this idea â€”

- Output an array which contains subarrays containing nodes at the same level (left to right).
- Same as above but the order at each level should be right to left.
- Same as above but in zigzag order, i.e., at each level the order should reverse.
- Output an array which contains the average value of each level.
- Output an array which contains the largest value at each level.
- Find the minimum depth which is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node to the nearest leaf node.
- Given a node in the tree. find the level order successor which is the node that appears right after the given node in the level order traversal.
