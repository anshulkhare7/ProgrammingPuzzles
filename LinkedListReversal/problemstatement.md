# In Place Linked List Reversal

This class of problems involve reversing a give linked list. The constraint is that we need to do it inplace, i.e., the space complexity should be O(1).

- Given the head pointer of a linkedlist, return the head of the reversed list.
— Given the head pointer of a linkedlist and two positions *a* and *b*, reverse the LinkedList from position *a* to *b*.
— Given the head pointer of a linkedlist and and a number **m**, reverse every **m** sized sub-list starting from the head. If, in the end, you are left with a sub-list with less than ‘k’ elements, reverse it too.
